|                                               | <span>We coupled encrypted data with additional information to facilitate third party analysis. The project was based on a mechanism for Homomorphically secure k-means clustering and the concept of an Updatable Distance Matrix (UDM). The evaluation henceforth showed that the proposed mechanism produced quite similar clustering results as when standard k-means is applied,but in a secure way. Both data privacy and correctness were preserved with the proposed mechanism.</span> |
