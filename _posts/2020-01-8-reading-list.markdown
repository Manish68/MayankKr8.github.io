I always enjoyed a good story or an article while growing up. But complete books were never my thing. I was afraid of committing (applies strictly to this) my time and then not get as happy or content as I thought or was promised. Hence I read books only when forced academically.

I have recently learnt that to live is to change. So I have started reading recently (who am I kidding, it was last year). I started with a book, which is recommended by everyone who believes in magic and unicorns. But it took me almost half a year to complete it, while my friends did a complete re-run of the entire series in less than a week. So since, I am not growing younger by the day, I decided to speed up things. I joined [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/kumar-mayank) which motivated me into taking a reading challenge. I settles for a modest 10 books for the year. While goodreads provides great lists, it doesn't have an abandoned list (or maybe I am too noob to find), which is a good gesture of respect towards books and authors. However, I am too new into the reading world for this.

I have got some great freinds, with very good recommendations, so I will be trusting them. I get my dose of drama from the movies and shows I watch so I have chosen non-fiction to be the genre to begin with. Why choose agenre at all you ask? I really want to hold on to this habbit/hobby and from what I believe, making it more organised will help me cross the tipping point easily. So I begin this journey.

Update(29 Jan 2020) I thought I will begin with non-fiction, but turns out I am sort of a sucker for a stories. Hey, stories can be enightening too. Before I drop this resoultion too soon, I have also developed a contingency plan with Science and Science Fiction. I have got a few inspirations like [Rohan Narayana Murty's](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~rohan/Books.html) list.
