So I write my first post for this website.

Since I have the luxury of time at the moment, I decided to make this website. After taking the initial theme I came across [Arti Annaswamy's](https://github.com/aannasw/aannasw.github.io) version of it. Coincidently she had this section of reading lists herself, which inspired me to write my first post (you might not believe this but I honestly don't care). 

I always enjoyed a good story or an article while growing up. But complete books were never my thing. I was afraid of committing (applies strictly to this) my time and then to not get as happy or content as I thought or was promised. Hence I read books only when forced academically.

In the last few years of my life I have learnt that, to live is to change. So I have started reading recently (who am I kidding, it was last year). I started with a book, which is recommended by everyone who believes in magic and unicorns. But it took me almost half a year to complete it, while my friends did a complete re-run of the entire series in less than a week. So since, I am not growing younger by the day, I decided to speed up things. I joined [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/kumar-mayank) which motivated me into taking a reading challenge. I settled for a modest 10 books for the year. 

_"You already have your goodreads' profile linked, why do you want to make another list?"_

While goodreads provides great lists, it doesn't have an abandoned list (or maybe I am too noob to find), which if true, is a good gesture of respect towards books and authors. However, I am too new into the reading world for this. So as I progress, I will keep udating a list of books I have read and the books I abandoned, with preferably a reason (I will try my best, no guarantees though).

I have got some great friends, with very good recommendations, so I will be trusting them. I get my dose of drama from the movies and shows I watch so I have chosen non-fiction to be the genre to begin with. Why choose a genre at all you ask? I really want to hold on to this habbit/hobby and from what I believe, making it more organised will help me cross the tipping point easily. So I begin this journey.

**Update(29 Jan 2020)** I thought I will begin with non-fiction, but turns out I am sort of a sucker for stories. 

_Hey, stories can be enlightening too_

Before I drop this resoultion too soon, I have also developed a contingency plan with Science and Science Fiction. I have got a few inspirations from [Rohan Narayana Murty's](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~rohan/Books.html) list.

        <p>I got this book solely on my admiration of the author's unique way of narration, where one finds a soul - a human connect. The book is an experimental genre, "LaPreK(Laghu Prem Katha; _translates to_ Short Love Stories). A compilation of one page lover-stories, mostly anecdotes set in a well known location of a city, most often Delhi. I have been to Delhi enough times to know about _Chandni Chowk ke paranthe_(Stuffed Indian Bread) and to even get memes based on Rajiv Chowk Metro Station. But there's still  a lot to discover. The book is based on Delhi landscapes, which maybe I haven't even heard of. Hence, this books lacks the emotional connect for me. And therefore, I not completely give up on this, but surely have no plans in the near future.
